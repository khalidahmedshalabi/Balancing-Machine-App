# Balancing Machine App
This app, based on given readings obtained from prepared analysis, contributes to the process of balancing machine: determining the location and amount of unbalanced masses on a rotor. 

Give required data to the app and watch it do all the work for you: calibration weight, correction weight, vibration comparison in tables and charts, polar graph, single-plane balancing calculator and double-plane balancing calculator.

All you do is entering data, nothing else, no joke. In addition, we realize the importance of your time, so we designed an auto-writer for your report. It writes most of your report as you work, you can give it a final look then print it. 

Moreover, it purposely takes a step-by-step-like design to simplify the whole process. Making it user-friendly was a design goal. 

Based on feedback from several engineers who tested the app before release, the app is proven to help you finish more work in much less time with less effort.

# Mechanical Engineering Background
The whole app was my uncle's (Mustafa Shalabi) idea since he's a mechanical engineer. I'm a software engineer. I don't know that much about rotary machinery engineering.
